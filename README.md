## Problem Solved

### Manual Flight Booking

In traditional flight booking systems, managing bookings, flights, and reservations manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. This system addresses these issues by automating the following tasks:

1. **User Management**: The system securely manages user accounts and login credentials, allowing users to book flights and manage their reservations effortlessly.

2. **Flight Management**: Admins can efficiently manage flights, update flight details, and ensure that all flights are up-to-date and accurately represented in the system.

3. **Reservation Management**: The system allows users to view, book, and cancel reservations in a few simple steps, making the entire process smooth and user-friendly.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. **Compile the Program**: Use a C compiler like `gcc`  or CODEBLOCS editor to compile the source code. the user name and password is daniel and daniel OR kambale and kambale OR knd and knd
3. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program to start the Flight Booking System.
4. **Navigate the Menu**: Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the user or admin modes.

## Problem Solved

This project aims to provide a simple yet functional flight booking system for users and administrators. It helps solve the problem of managing flight bookings in a small-scale environment where a web-based system might be unnecessary or too complex. The program stores all user and flight data in files, making it easy to manage and update.

## Future Enhancements

- **Flight Search**: Implement a flight search feature allowing users to find flights based on specific criteria.
- **Seat Management**: Include seat selection and availability features for a more detailed booking process.
- **Enhanced Security**: Improve the security of user data with encryption and more complex login mechanisms.
- **GUI Implementation**: Extend the program with a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
